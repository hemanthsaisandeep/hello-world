Hi everyone!
My name is B.Hemanth Sai Sandeep. 
I am second year undergraduate student of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its 4 year B.Tech.(Hons.) course. 
I want to learn to code to aid my studies and write small codes to help my work.
I am also interested in python owing to its possible implementations in scientific computing.
